    <p class="article-subhead">Things to Master Python</p>
    <p class="article-content">
        <div class="article-content">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Frameworks: </b>You should now learn to work on a framework. Python has some very powerful frameworks like Django, Flask, and CherryPy. You can begin with Django, which is a very powerful framework following the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle. It makes work easier for you and takes care of trivial things.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>ORM Libraries: </b>ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. This is a way to query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. You can learn to use ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy and Django ORM. This is easier and faster than writing SQL.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Front-End Technologies: </b>Technologies like HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript/jQuery are not a requirement to be a Python developer. But if you can, try to gain a basic understanding of these, and they will let you understand how things work and what is possible. As a Python developer, you may need to work with the front-end team.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Version Control: </b>Changes to a code multiple times by multiple people can ultimately break it. You should learn GitHub and its simple terms like push, pull, fork, and commit if you want to implement version control (you should).</li>
